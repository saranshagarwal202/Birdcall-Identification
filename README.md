# Birdcall-Identification
In this Kaggle competition, I made an Audio Processing Pipeline, using PyDub, TensorFlow and Keras, creating a final set of binary TensorFlow Record files. With minimal RAM, Mel Spectrograms generated using Librosa were fed to train a WaveNet-like model for multi-class classification for 264 classes. In another variation of the model, feature extraction layers from a trained ResNet, and VGG-16 have also been applied, and their usefulness monitored.
